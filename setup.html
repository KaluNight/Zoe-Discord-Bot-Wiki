</figure>
<p>Be aware that to set up and use Zoe you need the "manage channels" permission on your server (if you are not the administrator anyway).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Adding Zoe</h2>
<p>You can add Zoe to your server by clicking on "Add the bot" on the homepage, on sites like <a href="https://top.gg/de/bot/550737379460382752">top.gg </a>or <a href="https://bots.ondiscord.xyz/bots/550737379460382752">bots.ondiscord.xyz</a> and here on the Wiki in the bottom left in the menu bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Authorizing Zoe</h2>
<p>Now you may have to log in to Discord, then select the server you want to add Zoe to and confirm Zoe's permissions. You may have to solve a captcha and then you can start.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/new_setup1-3.png"></figure>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>When Zoe is added for the first time, it sends a short message to the default channel of the server.</p>
<p>Then follows the first setting. You should select the language you want Zoe to speak on your server. (For more information, see <a href="https://wiki.zoe-discord-bot.ch/en/commands/important/language"><code>/language</code></a>). You can navigate with the reactions and then confirm the language you want Zoe to speak.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/new_setup5.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Directly after that, you have to select the standard League of Legends server region. Available are the following tags:</p>
<figure class="table">

        <th>EUW&nbsp;</th>
        <th>LAN</th>
        <th>LAS&nbsp;</th>
        <th>NA&nbsp;</th>

<figure class="image"><img src="/new_setup4.png"></figure>
<p>Now Zoe sends another message about what you can do next. Read more in the next section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Adding data (aka registering players)</h2>
<p>To use Zoe, you must first register players. A player consists of a Discord account and one or more League accounts and will be displayed in the various features you will use. You can create them with the commands <a href="https://wiki.zoe-discord-bot.ch/en/commands/create/player"><code>/create player</code></a> (allows you to register a discord account with a League account) and <a href="https://wiki.zoe-discord-bot.ch/en/commands/add/account"><code>/add account</code></a> (allows you to add a League account to an already registered discord account). To delete them, use the commands <a href="https://wiki.zoe-discord-bot.ch/en/commands/delete/player"><code>/delete player</code></a> (delete the player) and <a href="https://wiki.zoe-discord-bot.ch/en/commands/remove/account"><code>/remove account</code></a> (delete a player's League account). You can display the registered players with the <a href="https://wiki.zoe-discord-bot.ch/en/commands/important/show-players"><code>/show players</code></a> command if you wish.</p>
