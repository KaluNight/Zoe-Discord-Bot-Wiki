<p>Be aware that to set up and use Zoe you need the "manage channels" permission on your server (if you are not the administrator anyway).</p>
<h2>Adding Zoe</h2>
<p>You can add Zoe to your server by clicking on "Add the bot" on the homepage, on sites like top.gg or bots.ondiscord.xyz and here on the Wiki in the bottom left menu bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Authorizing Zoe</h2>
<p>Now you have to log in to discord if necessary, then select the server you want to add Zoe to and confirm Z oe's permissions. You may still have to solve a captcha and then you can start.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>When Zoe is added for the first time, she sends a short message to the server's default channel.</p>
<p>Then the first setting follows. You should select the language that Zoe should speak on your server. (For more information see &gt;language). You can navigate with the reactions and thrn confirm the language you want Zoe zo speak.</p>
