<p>Be aware that to set up and use Zoe you need the "manage channels" permission on your server (if you are not the administrator anyway).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Adding Zoe</h2>
<p>You can add Zoe to your server by clicking on "Add the bot" on the homepage, on sites like top.gg or bots.ondiscord.xyz and here on the Wiki in the bottom left in the menu bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Authorizing Zoe</h2>
<p>Now you have to log in to Discord if necessary, then select the server you want to add Zoe to and confirm Zoe's permissions. You may still have to solve a captcha and then you can start.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>When Zoe is added for the first time, she sends a short message to the server's default channel.</p>
<p>Then the first setting follows. You should select the language that Zoe should speak on your server. (For more information see &gt;language). You can navigate with the reactions and thrn confirm the language you want Zoe zo speak.</p>

<p>Directly after that, you have to select the standard League of Legends server region. Available are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>BR - Brazil</li>
  <li>EUNE - Europe Nordic &amp; East</li>
  <li>EUW - Europe West</li>
  <li>LAN - Latin America North</li>
  <li>LAS - Latin America South</li>
  <li>NA - North America</li>
  <li>OCE - Oceania</li>
  <li>RU - Russia</li>
  <li>TR - Turkey</li>
  <li>JP - Japan</li>
  <li>KR - Republic of Korea</li>
</ul>
<p>You can change this setting later in the cofiguration if you wish (see &gt;config).</p>
