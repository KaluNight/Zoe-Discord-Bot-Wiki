# Translation Guidelines
## Preconditions
<br>

- Understanding of the English language
- Good understanding of the target language (preferabky mother tongue)
- Some time
<br>

## Essentials

**The translation proceeds as follows:**

After you have chosen your language, you will gradually receive sentences and longer texts that you have to translate in such a way that they are understandable and clear for the speakers of the language.

> In the text, you will find variables such as `%s`, Discord Emotes (like `:star:`) and punctuation marks or markdown syntax like `*` and `'` , which you must also include in your translation.
>
>You will also find keywords like `YES` or `OK` which you need to keep aswell. You cannot translate them!	
>{.is-info}

<br>

## FAQ
> Do I need to translate words like "information panel", "infochannel" or similar?

> It depends on whether the people who speak your language would understand. If not, you also translate them.
Please check the [Zoe Terms for translating](/en/translation/terms) for more information and if possible add your translated terms.

> What if my language is read and written from right to left?

> Then you write from right to left. Make sure that commands and the variables like `%s` must still be `%s`. You are not allowed to turn the characters around (~~s%~~).
