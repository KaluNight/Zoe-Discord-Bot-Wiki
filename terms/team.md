# What is a team?
## Information
**In relation to Zoe, a team consists of a different number of [players](/en/terms/player). You can choose a name for the team as you wish. A team is displayed in the [infopanel](/en/features/infochannel), where the average rank of all [players](/en/terms/player) in the team is also displayed. It is possible to create a [matchhistorychannel](/en/features/matchhistorychannel) team specifically and a team can be displayed with [`/show team`](/en/commands/team/show).**
