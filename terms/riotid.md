# What is a Riot ID?
## Information
**Every League of Legends player has chosen a Riot ID when creating their account or at Riot ID transition day (in November 2023). Changing it will change how you appear in-game (although you only see the gamename ingame).**

**Your Riot ID is divided into two parts. For example:
My _Riot ID_ is `Star Guardian Ez#real`,
so my _gamename_ is `Star Guardian Ez` 
and my _tagline_ is `#real` or better `real`**

**Your gamename does not have to be unique. So as long as your Riot ID (as a whole) isn't taken, you can have any gamename you like. So make sure you use the right tagline with your gamename.
Taglines start with a region code by default, but once you've changed them, you cannot go back to using any [region code](/en/terms/region).** <br>
**There are 2 scenarios that can occur with Zoe:**
:one: You have to enter your `gamename` and `tagline` separately
There are then 2 separate input fields in which you only enter the text (no hashtag).
:two: You have to enter the whole `Riot ID`
Here you must enter the entire ID in the specified field, including the hashtag in the middle.

If you want to learn more about Riot IDs you can check out the [Riot news article: Riot ID Transition](https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/reworking-the-riot-id-transition-plan) and the [Riot support article: Changing your Riot ID](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/20631044642963).
