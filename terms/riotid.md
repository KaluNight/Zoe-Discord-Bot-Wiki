# What is a Riot ID?

>### Information
>**Every League of Legends player has chosen a Riot ID when creating their account or at Riot ID transition day (in November 2023). Changing it will change how you appear in-game (although you only see the gamename ingame).**
>
> **Your Riot ID is divided into two parts. For example:
My _Riot ID_ is `Star Guardian Ez#real`,
so my _gamename_ is `Star Guardian Ez` 
and my _tagline_ is `#real`**
>
>**Your gamename does not have to be unique. So as long as your Riot ID (as a whole) isn't taken, you can have any gamename you like. So make sure you use the right tagline with your gamename.
Taglines start with a region code by default, but once you've changed them, you cannot go back to using any [region code](/en/terms/region).**
