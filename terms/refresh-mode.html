<h1>Refresh mode</h1>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p>The refresh mode or refresh rate is set automatically by Zoe, depending on how Zoe is loaded. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Classic mode</h2>
<p>When the load is low, Zoe remains in classic mode and updates everything by default rates. However, the refresh command always works. A refresh can be triggered by the detection of game with Discord Presence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Smart mode</h2>
<p>If many players are playing and the load is high, Zoe switches to smart mode and only updates the info panel (or sends the game cards) when it detects a game with a Discord presence (status) of a player. The refresh command still work in this mode.</p>
