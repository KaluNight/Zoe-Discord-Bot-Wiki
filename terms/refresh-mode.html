<h1>Refresh mode</h1>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p>The refresh mode is set automatically by Zoe, depending on how Zoe is loaded. When Zoe is in classic mode, the showed refresh rate is an estimation since she doesn't work technically with a refresh rate. Zoe refreshes each servers as fast as she can.</p>

<h2>Refresh With Game Detection (smart mode)</h2>
<p>When a registered user has Discord Presence enabled, Zoe can see the start of a game and will trigger a refresh. This increases the reactivity of Zoe by a ton. This is why it is highly recommended to have Discord Presence enabled if you want to have a good result from Zoe.</p>
<p>Note : If you are sharing your screen with the built-in Stream feature of Discord, the game won't be detected. (Because it's showing “Currently streaming League of Legends” instead of “In game”).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Refresh Command</h2>
<p>This is a command that triggers a refresh of the whole server (infochannel, rank channel and leaderboards / Not Clash Channel).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Passive Refresh (classic mode)</h2>
<p>Zoe refreshs each server one by one. The refresh rate is an estimation of how many time this will take to refresh all servers. When the refresh rate is higher than 60 minutes, smart mode is triggered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Small summary</h2>
<p>Here's what type of refresh each mode does:</p>
