<h1>Refresh mode</h1>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p>The refresh mode or refresh rate is set automatically by Zoe, depending on how Zoe is loaded. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Refresh With Game Detection&nbsp;</h2>
<p>When a registered user has Discord Presence enabled, Zoe can see the start of a game. This increases the reactivity of Zoe by a ton. This is why it is highly recommended to have Discord Presence enabled if you want to have quick results from Zoe.</p>
<p>Note : If you are sharing your screen with the built-in Stream feature of Discord, the game won't be detected. (Because it's show “Currently streaming League of Legends” instead of “In game”).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Smart mode</h2>
<p>If many players are playing and the load is high, Zoe switches to smart mode and only updates the info panel (or sends the game cards) when it detects a game with a Discord presence (status) of a player. The refresh command still work in this mode.</p>
<h2>Small summary</h2>
<p>Here's what type of refresh each mode does :</p>
