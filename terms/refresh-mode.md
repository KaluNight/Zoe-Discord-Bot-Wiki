# Refresh & Refresh mode

## Information

Â All servers are updated at least once an hour. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to increase this in a stable way.

What you can do is be online and activate Discord presence, Zoe will detect the start and end of your game and update directly at the right time. This is sufficient for most cases.

There are plans to rework the refresh system to make it smarter, with a system that detects the hours of activity per account and refreshes them more frequently during those periods. But this isnt implemented yet.

## Refresh With Game Detection (smart mode)

If a registered user has activated the Discord presence, Zoe can see the start and end of a game and will trigger an update. This increases Zoe's responsiveness many times over. Therefore, it is highly recommended to activate the Discord presence if you want to get good & fast results with Zoe.

Note: If you share your screen with Discord's built-in stream function, the game will not be detected. (This is because "Currently streaming League of Legends" is displayed instead of "In game").

## Refresh Command

This is a command that triggers a refresh manually for one server.
