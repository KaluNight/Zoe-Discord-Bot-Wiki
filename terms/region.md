# What is a region?
## Information
**Every League of Legends player plays on a server that is located in or near their country (or even far away if the player wants to play in other regions).
These servers are located in certain regions and are abbreviated with tags that have 2 to 4 letters. 
In order for Zoe to find your account on the right server, you must specify the region when creating, registering or adding an account.**
