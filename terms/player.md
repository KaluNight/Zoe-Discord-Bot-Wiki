# What is a player?

>### Information
>**A player in relation to Zoe, consists of a discord account ([id](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-)) and one or more League of Legends accounts ([Region](/en/terms/region) & [Riot ID](/en/terms/riotid)) that have been "linked" to it. The connection can be made by administrators with [`/create player`](/en/commands/player/create) or by yourself (if enabled) with [`/register`](/en/commands/player/register).
To add more League of Legend accounts to your player, use the command [`/add account`](/en/commands/player/addaccount).**
>
>**In the config of Zoe you can set whether players who leave the server should be automatically deleted. Alternatively, an adminstrator can do this manually with [`/delete player`](/en/commands/player/delete)**.
