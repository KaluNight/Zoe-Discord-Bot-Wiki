<p>**Automated Discord role by League rank:**</p>
<p>You can set up an automatic rank system easily with Zoe. The roles will be refreshed regularly automatically. The premium version of this feature offers more options (filter by server, display of each division, full control over each role and more). &nbsp;</p>

<p>Option in activation: **%s**</p>
<p>If you activate this option, a role is created for each league rank. Each registered player receives a role that corresponds to his rank. It is updated at the same time as the Info Channel and the Rank Channel and can be updated with ``/refresh``. You can change these roles as you wish (name, colour, permissions, ...) as long as Zoe can assign them to players. If a role is deleted, the option still works with the remaining role (you can use this to show only a specific rank).</p>
