<h1>Rank roles&nbsp;</h1>
<p>There are two instances of rank roles. You need a premium server to access advanced rank roles. Therefore, this page is divided into two parts. If you want to learn more about premium rank roles click on the right tab.</p>
<p>What are rank roles?</p>
<p>Discord roles for users of a Discord server are a great thing. Zoe provides rank roles based on the rank of the connected League of Legends account for every player and updates them regularly. You can still customise these roles in their name, color and permissions after they have been created. Keep in mind that Zoe needs to have the permissions to assign them still.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If a role is deleted, the feature still works with the remaining roles (you can use this to show only a specific ranks if you wish).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature is available free of charge to all users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To activate rank roles use the command /config and select the option automatic rank roles in the dropdown menu. Then select Option 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If necessary, read the description and confirm the activation with Accept and then select for which queues/modes the roles should count. Use the buttons to activate or deactivate the categories. You have the choice between Solo/DuoQ, Flex and TFT. Then confirm this selection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then it takes a short moment, because Zoe has to create a role for each League of Legends rank. after a refresh the roles are then assigned to all registered players.</p>
