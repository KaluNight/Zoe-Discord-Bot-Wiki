# Rankchannel

<br>

>**In the rankchannel, it is possible to follow the players' progress in the ranked climb. Zoe sends a short summary of the game after each ranked game of a registered player. In the promotions to a higher rank, this is also displayed and you can follow how things are going. Daily, weekly and monthly [rankupdates](/en/commands/stats/rankupdate) are also sent in here.**
