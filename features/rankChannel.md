# Rankchannel

<br>

>**In the rankchannel, it is possible to follow all [players](/en/terms/player)' (no limit) progress in the ranked climb. Zoe sends a short summary of the game after each ranked game of a registered [player](/en/terms/player). In the promotions to a higher rank, this is also displayed and you can follow how things are going. Daily, weekly and monthly [rankupdates](/en/commands/stats/rankupdate) are also sent in here.**
