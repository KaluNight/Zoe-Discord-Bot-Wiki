# Infochannel / Infopanel

<br> 

>**In the infochannel, Zoe sends the so-called infopanel in which information about the registered players, their accounts and (if enabled) their rank of a certain queue or the last game played is shown. Zoe also sends the gamecards to this channel (if enabled). You can read more about gamecards in this article: [gamecards](/en/features/gamecards)). You can also get champion tips for every champion played in a game. Read more here: [Champion analysis](/en/features/champion-analysis).**
