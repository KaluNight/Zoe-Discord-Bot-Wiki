<h2>Information</h2>
<p><strong>In the Rank Channel, it is possible to follow the players' progress in the rankings. Zoe sends a short summary of the game after each ranked game of a registered player. In the promotions to a higher rank, this is also displayed and you can follow how things are going.</strong></p>
