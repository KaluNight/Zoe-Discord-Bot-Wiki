# leaderboards

## Information

**In leaderboards (currently) up to 10 players can compare themselves in a selected category. You can select these in a creation wizard. The following goals can be aimed at:**

-   Total Mastery Points
-   Mastery Points on a champion
-   Rank in a Queue (Solo/DuoQ, Flex, etc)
-   All Queue Rank
-   Average KDA
-   Average KDA on a champion
-   Best Champion ("OTP")
-   Account Level

Information: If a leaderboard is no longer included in the latest 20 messages of a channel, it will no longer be updated. This is why we recommend to put leaderboards in a seperate channel.
