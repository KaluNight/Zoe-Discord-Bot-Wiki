# Leaderboards

<br>

>**In leaderboards up to 100 players (on a [boosted server](https://wiki.zoe-discord-bot.ch/en/Zoe-Points-And-Boosting), else 10) can compare themselves in a selected category. You can select these in a creation wizard. <br>
The following goals can be aimed at: Total Mastery Points, Mastery Points on a champion, Rank in a Queue (Solo/DuoQ, Flex, etc.), All Queue Rank, Average KDA, Average KDA on a champion, Best Champion ("OTP") & Account Level**
>
>Note: For the calculation of the average KDA leaderboard all games/all game types in the last month are taken into account.

> **Attention:** If a leaderboard is no longer included in the latest 20 messages of a channel, it will no longer be updated. This is why we recommend to put leaderboards in a seperate channel.
