# Leaderboards

<br>

>**In leaderboards (currently) up to 10 players can compare themselves in a selected category. You can select these in a creation wizard. <br>
The following goals can be aimed at: Total Mastery Points, Mastery Points on a champion, Rank in a Queue (Solo/DuoQ, Flex, etc.), All Queue Rank, Average KDA, Average KDA on a champion, Best Champion ("OTP") & Account Level**

> **Attention:** If a leaderboard is no longer included in the latest 20 messages of a channel, it will no longer be updated. This is why we recommend to put leaderboards in a seperate channel.
