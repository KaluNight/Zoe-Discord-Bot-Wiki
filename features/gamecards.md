# Infochannel / Gamecards

<br>

>**When a match is started and a [player](/en/terms/player) is in a live match, Zoe sends a gamecard to the [infochannel](/en/features/infoChannel). There, the [players](/en/terms/player) and champions of the own and the opposing team are displayed with their ranks, their mastery and their mindset (win/loss series).**
>
>**You can also get champion tips for every champion played in a game. Read more here: [Champion Analysis](/en/features/champion-analysis)**
