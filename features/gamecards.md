# Infochannel / Gamecards
## Information
**When a (League of Legends) match is started and a [player](/en/terms/player) is in a live match, Zoe sends a gamecard to the [infochannel](/en/features/infochannel). There, the [players](/en/terms/player) and champions of the own and the opposing team are displayed with their ranks, their mastery and their mindset (win/loss series). The gamecards are sent in while the game is still running and will get deleted afterwards.**

**You can also get champion tips for every champion played in a game. Read more here: [Champion Analysis](/en/features/champion-analysis)**
