<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How can I deactivate smart mode / change the mode?</h2>
<p>As a user, you cannot deactivate smart mode or change the mode itself. Zoe automatically decides which mode to run in based on the current load. If you want to learn more about refreshing click <a href="https://wiki.zoe-discord-bot.ch/en/terms/refresh-mode/">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>In which languages is Zoe available ?</h2>
<p>Zoe is currently fully translated into English and German and partially translated into French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, Russian and Arabic as well as Turkish. These translations are done by the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can I define several channels (Info &amp; RankChannel) in one text channel?</h2>
<p>Yes, this works in itself, but not really, because all messages in Zoe's info channel that do not belong there are deleted, including those from the RankChannel. Please try to not mix these channels.</p>
<p>If you have the problem that the messages are deleted, you can undefine one of the two channels and define it again in another text channel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Which games are / why is flex&nbsp;displayed in infopanel?</h2>
<p>The InfoPanel always shows the last update of the rank. If your last game was a flex game, this change is shown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why don't I see any slash commands / they don't work?</h2>
<p>This can have 2 possible causes. First, you have not given Zoe permission to use the commands on your server. Please go into Zoe's role permissions and enable them. If it still does not work, it is most likely because you invited Zoe with the old invitation link that did not have a setting enabled that allows Zoe to use the commands. Since these links should be updated, you can kick Zoe and invite her again using a new link, then the /commands should work. Don't worry, your config will be saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How can I support Zoe?</h2>
<p>You can support us monthly with a small amount and get some cool features on top. Find out more <a href="/en/support/">here</a>. Or visit the donation website <a href="https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/donate.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Where can I see what will be developed next?</h2>
<p>On the dev discord server you can check out what great features are planned next and in the future. If you have suggestions that don't exist yet, you can let us know on the server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Do I need to do anything to get Zoe to update the infoboard or gamecards etc.?</h2>
<p>No you don't have to do anything, but if you want to force a manual refresh you can use the <a href="/en/commands/important/refresh/">refresh command</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a problem, you can report it on the discord server.</p>
