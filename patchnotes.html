          <h3><strong>V1.10.1 -&gt; V1.10.2</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
          <p><strong>MAJOR FIX</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Zoe now responds correctly to commands even when she is overloaded. This problem was a pain to solve and took a long time to fix but it's finally fixed now! I'm really sorry for the delay.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Bug Fix</strong></p>
          <p>A long range of small bug has been fixed. (Related to analysis, clash channel and more)</p>

          <h2><strong>Zoe Sharding System and Rank data fix</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
          <h3><strong>V1.10.0 -&gt; V1.10.1</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
          <p><i><strong>Hidden Feature</strong></i></p>
          <p>Zoe has now multiple shard, this allow her to support more servers. You are more than 10'000 users! Thanks you for this!</p>
          <p><i><strong>Bug Fix</strong></i></p>
          <p>Sometimes Zoe skip some ranked match (happens most of the time when she is overloaded). We update rank of players with ranked match to avoid the spam of Riot servers (if a ranked game is detected -&gt; the rank will change in some time). But because of that sometimes data are old and not updated. Since this is pretty hard to fix this issue quickly (need to rework the way the system work), i make a way to bypass it. Now the&nbsp;&gt;refresh command force the refresh of the ranked cache. This should fix issue with leaderboard old data.</p>
          <p><i>Note: This can possibly remove the sending of rank channel message in some rare edge case.</i></p>
          <p><strong>Next patch:</strong></p>
          <p>Overall improvements and new small features asked by users. (3-6 months) Like always, if you have some bugs, feedback or request don't hesitate to report them in the appropriate channels.</p>
