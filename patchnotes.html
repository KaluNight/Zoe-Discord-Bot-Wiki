          <h2><strong>Subscription Update V2, new features and adaptation for slash commands | Version 1.12</strong></h2>
          <h3><strong>V1.11.1 → V1.12</strong></h3>
          <p>Let's start right away with the core piece of this update: <strong>The new Premium subscription.</strong> Before this update, Zoe's premium subscription was mainly cosmetic and not very attractive. As it is important to be able to finance Zoe in the long term, a solution had to be found. So it was decided to create some premium features. I'll say it again because I don't want to scare you. All the features currently available for free will of course remain free. This subscription will have access to some exclusive features, but the development of the free features will of course not stop (and you will see it here).</p>
          <p><strong>To gain access to these new features, a new premium server system has been created.</strong> As a subscriber, you can "boost" a server with "Zoe points" to give it access to premium features. The number of points depends on the particular subscription you have taken out. Here you can see how many points each subscription gives:</p>
          <p>- Platinum (2 €) : 1 Zoe Point</p>
          <p>- Diamond (5 €) : 3 Zoe Points</p>
          <p>- Master (formerly Challenger) (10 €) : 6 Zoe Points</p>
          <p>- Grandmaster (20 €) : 12 Zoe Points</p>
          <p>- Challenger (30 €) : 18 Zoe Points</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The number of points needed to boost a server depends on the number of League of Legends accounts registered on the server. Here is a list of the different sizes:</p>
          <p>- Small server / 1 Zoe Point: 0-30 League accounts</p>
          <p>- Medium Server / 3 Zoe Points: 31-120 League accounts</p>
          <p>- Large Server / 6 Zoe Points: 121-Infinite League accounts</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Every time you boost a server, points are taken away from it. However, you can cancel the boost at any time to get your points back.</p>
          <p>For more information about this point system. Use the commands ``/subscription`` and ``/boost`` in Discord and read this article &lt;https://wiki.zoe-discord-bot.ch/en/Zoe-Points-And-Boosting&gt;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Now, let's move on to the new features!</p>
          <h4><strong>1. Premium Server | Improved Rank Role Feature (/config -&gt; Additional Features)</strong></h4>
          <p>As you probably know, Zoe already has an automatic role system based on League of Legends rank. This option is good, but too simple. This new option should allow you to configure your roles down to the smallest detail. Whether by queue (Soloq, Flex and TFT), by division or rank, or by server, anything works! This is the most complex option I have had to develop so far, and by a large margin.</p>
          <p>Here are some screenshots of the menus of the option:</p>
          <p><i>The option allows you to make a pre-configuration</i></p>

          <p><a href="https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/ImprovedRankRoleMenu2.png">https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/ImprovedRankRoleMenu2.png</a></p>
          <p><i>You can then modify each role in detail</i></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4><strong>2. Premium Server | Bigger Leaderboard</strong></h4>
          <p>This highly anticipated feature allows you to increase the size of the leaderboards to the maximum size of 100 players displayed. You can change the size of the leaderboards with the new button below the leaderboards or during creation.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>3. Early access for Premium Server and Premium User | Infocards Champions Stats</h4>
          <p>This option allows you to get information about a champion. Spell to max or items, you have quick and easy access to this information. You can access this information directly from the info cards by pressing the new button below. <i>There are plans to add rune stats at a later date.</i></p>
          <p><strong>This option will be free on 31 August</strong>!</p>
          <p>Here is an example: <a href="https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/InfoCardsChampionStats.png">https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/img/InfoCardsChampionStats.png</a></p>
          <p><i>Will be available only after a few hours the patch note</i></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>4. Free | Disable auto-remove players Option (/config -&gt; User Management)</h4>
          <p>When a player leaves a server, they are automatically deleted. This new option allows you to remove this behaviour if you wish.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>5. Premium Server | Filter Infocards by Game type - Option (/config -&gt; Info Channel Settings)</h4>
          <p>This option allows you to filter the type of info cards generated according to the type of game being played. Perfect for large servers that want to filter what is displayed (e.g. Solo/DuoQ only).</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>I have prepared Zoe for the end of the classic commands.</strong> Zoe will no longer be usable with "&gt;" as of August 31th. I recommend you to use slash commands which works with "/". If you have problems with slash commands, you can use this command format after August 31 only: "@Zoe#7767 example command".</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Other small changes include:</strong></p>
          <p>- The addition of the ``/help``, ``/define`` and ``/undefine`` commands to the slash commands. I had forgotten them when I updated the slash commands :')</p>
          <p>- Adjustment of some commands to the new Discord operation from 31 August.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>As always with this type of large update, unexpected errors may occur. I invite you to report them on the server in the #report-issue channel. If you have any comments, suggestions for improvement or other feedback, I invite you to talk about it under #feedback. I am still looking forward to your comments :ZoeJoy:.</p>
          <p><strong>I sincerely hope that you will enjoy this update. I have been working on it for a long time and I hope it will not disappoint you.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A big thank you to everyone who has supported me financially to date, including aclcdarktronic, SUNBOOP, SebastianNoll, Deamon, sileNtF1, ninjoi as well as all the other people with lower tiers! Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. I also have a thought for my moderators who provide me with valuable help! I really thank you guys!</strong></p>
          <p>And thank you to everyone who uses Zoe! It's a pleasure to see you using the fruits of my labour ! &lt;3</p>

          <p>This patch note contains all the changes that have been made since November. I'll probably forget some things as there were a lot of them, but here are the main additions:</p>

          <p>- <strong>Optimization</strong> Added a cache for the match history.</p>

          <h2>Match-V5 update (Major background update)</h2>
          <h3>V1.11.0.2.1 -&gt; V1.11.0.2.2</h3>
          <p>Hello everyone! This update allows Zoe to use the new Riot api for matches (also called Match-V5). In addition to this simple update, the entire Riot server calling system has been updated with the migration to the R4J library. And not least, the entire caching system has been redone with a dedicated MongoDB database. The update caused some problems. The winrates for infocards are temporarily disabled to compensate for the overload.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-<strong>Update</strong> Zoe can now use the new match api (Match-V5)</p>
          <p>-<strong>Migration</strong> The entire system of calls to Riot servers has been updated.</p>
          <p>-<strong>Rework</strong> The data cache system has been migrated to a dedicated database to avoid performance problems.</p>
          <p>-<strong>Temporary issue</strong> Winrates in infocards have been disabled due to the limited access to Riot's servers (new access limit with this new system). I work on it.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Next patch</strong>: Features asked by users (For more information, please check #dev-status)</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Disclaimer: You may not realise it but the scale of this update is very large. There is a higher probability of new bugs in already existent features than in other updates. Please report them so I can fix them quickly.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Like always, if you have some bugs, feedback or request don't hesitate to report them in the appropriate channels.</p>

          <h3><strong>V1.11.0.1 -&gt; V1.11.0.2</strong></h3>
          <p>Big update today. It's a major update because it's the launch of Zoe's subscription system! Don't be afraid, Zoe will always remain entirely free. It is above all a support subscription that allows those who wish to have access to certain advantages. If you want to know in detail why I am launching this subscription, you can see this blog post I wrote:&nbsp;<a href="https://ko-fi.com/Blog/Post/Why-did-I-launch-a-Ko-fi-page-and-a-subscription-s-T6T55LKE3">https://ko-fi.com/Blog/Post/Why-did-I-launch-a-Ko-fi-page-and-a-subscription-s-T6T55LKE3</a> If you were already supporting Zoe on Patreon contact me in dm. This update also adds a new option very useful for large servers (Force Ownership Verification of the League Account) and the rework of the command&nbsp;&gt;config.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>New</strong>:</p>
          <p>You can now support Zoe with a subscription! This will give you access to some advantages such as an <i>evolving icon</i> in front of your nickname, <i>exclusive information about future features</i> or an <i>early access to future features</i>. For more info:&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/support-zoe">https://bit.ly/support-zoe</a> -&gt; Small messages will promote the subscription through the features.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Here are the chances to see a promotion message:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-100% of the time on the Info Channel.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-10% of the time in a Rank Channel Message.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-10% of the time in a Leaderboard refresh. The message is made to be discreet and not intrusive.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>I would like to get your feedback on whether this is something that annoys you or not.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-&gt; To check your subscription status, use&nbsp;&gt;subscription&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Rework</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The config command has been reworked to accept new options more easily! Try it with the&nbsp;&gt;config command.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>New Feature in Early Access || Available for everyone the 22.08.2021</strong>: Force Verification Option !</p>
          <p>&nbsp;You want to be sure that this strange person claiming to be a challenger in your server really is? Enable the "Force Verification Account" option to force users to verify that the League account is really theirs. Use&nbsp;&gt;config -&gt; User management to set it up.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Next patch <strong>V1.11.0.4</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Order the players inside the Info cards about games by roles. Like always, if you have some bugs, feedback or request don't hesitate to report them in the appropriate channels.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>Zoe Sharding System and Rank data fix</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
          <h3><strong>V1.10.0 -&gt; V1.10.1</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
          <p><i><strong>Hidden Feature</strong></i></p>
          <p>Zoe has now multiple shard, this allow her to support more servers. You are more than 10'000 users! Thanks you for this!</p>
          <p><i><strong>Bug Fix</strong></i></p>
          <p>Sometimes Zoe skip some ranked match (happens most of the time when she is overloaded). We update rank of players with ranked match to avoid the spam of Riot servers (if a ranked game is detected -&gt; the rank will change in some time). But because of that sometimes data are old and not updated. Since this is pretty hard to fix this issue quickly (need to rework the way the system work), i make a way to bypass it. Now the&nbsp;&gt;refresh command force the refresh of the ranked cache. This should fix issue with leaderboard old data.</p>
          <p><i>Note: This can possibly remove the sending of rank channel message in some rare edge case.</i></p>
          <p><strong>Next patch:</strong></p>
          <p>Overall improvements and new small features asked by users. (3-6 months) Like always, if you have some bugs, feedback or request don't hesitate to report them in the appropriate channels.</p>
