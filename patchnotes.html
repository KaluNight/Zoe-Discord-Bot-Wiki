          <h2>Match-V5 update (Major background update)</h2>
          <h3>V1.11.0.2.1 -&gt; V1.11.0.2.2</h3>
          <p>Hello everyone! This update allows Zoe to use the new Riot api for matches (also called Match-V5). In addition to this simple update, the entire Riot server calling system has been updated with the migration to the R4J library. And not least, the entire caching system has been redone with a dedicated MongoDB database. The update caused some problems. The winrates for infocards are temporarily disabled to compensate for the overload.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>-Update Zoe can now use the new match api (Match-V5)</p>
          <p>-Migration The entire system of calls to Riot servers has been updated.</p>
          <p>-Rework The data cache system has been migrated to a dedicated database to avoid performance problems.</p>
          <p>-Temporary issue Winrates in infocards have been disabled due to the limited access to Riot's servers (new access limit with this new system). I work on it.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Next patch: Features asked by users (For more information, please check #dev-status)</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Disclaimer: You may not realise it but the scale of this update is very large. There is a higher probability of new bugs in already existent features than in other updates. Please report them so I can fix them quickly.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Like always, if you have some bugs, feedback or request don't hesitate to report them in the appropriate channels.</p>

          <p><strong>MAJOR FIX</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Zoe now responds correctly to commands even when she is overloaded. This problem was a pain to solve and took a long time to fix but it's finally fixed now! I'm really sorry for the delay.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>Zoe Sharding System and Rank data fix</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
          <h3><strong>V1.10.0 -&gt; V1.10.1</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
          <p><i><strong>Hidden Feature</strong></i></p>
          <p>Zoe has now multiple shard, this allow her to support more servers. You are more than 10'000 users! Thanks you for this!</p>
          <p><i><strong>Bug Fix</strong></i></p>
          <p>Sometimes Zoe skip some ranked match (happens most of the time when she is overloaded). We update rank of players with ranked match to avoid the spam of Riot servers (if a ranked game is detected -&gt; the rank will change in some time). But because of that sometimes data are old and not updated. Since this is pretty hard to fix this issue quickly (need to rework the way the system work), i make a way to bypass it. Now the&nbsp;&gt;refresh command force the refresh of the ranked cache. This should fix issue with leaderboard old data.</p>
          <p><i>Note: This can possibly remove the sending of rank channel message in some rare edge case.</i></p>
          <p><strong>Next patch:</strong></p>
          <p>Overall improvements and new small features asked by users. (3-6 months) Like always, if you have some bugs, feedback or request don't hesitate to report them in the appropriate channels.</p>
