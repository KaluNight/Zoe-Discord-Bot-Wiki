<h1>Usage of Zoe Points</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Zoe points are used to boost a Discord server to gain access to the premium features. You can manage the servers you boost with the <a href="/en/commands/subscription/boost"><code>/boost</code></a> command.&nbsp;<br><br>Depending on your subscription, you will receive a certain number of Zoe points. Here is the list:</p>

  <p>Depending on the server you are boosting, more or less Zoe points are needed. Here you can see how many Zoe points a server uses depending on its size:</p>

  <p>Once a server is boosted, you can enable&nbsp;premium features on it. With a subscription, you get a certain number of Zoe points that you can use. So you can distribute your points as you wish, as long as you have enough Zoe points.</p>

<h2>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>What happens when I stop boosting a server?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The server's premium features&nbsp;no longer work and you will get your Zoe points back. You can use them again directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What happens if my server with premium features&nbsp;is no longer boosted?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The premium features&nbsp;will then no longer work, but your settings will not be deleted. So if you do not change your configuration in the meantime, a re-boost of your server will reactivate the premium features&nbsp;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What happens if a server changes its size (and therefore category) while I am boosting it?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>It depends on the number of points you have left. Two cases can occur:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Either you have enough Zoe points left and the server remains boosted.</li>
    <li>Or you do not have enough Zoe points and become overloaded. In this case you will receive a message warning you. Now you have several options: Cancel your boost on some servers, delete some league accounts from a server (to lower its category) or take a higher subscription to receive more points.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><strong>If you decide to upgrade to a higher subscription tier due to a larger server size (while your old subscription tier is still active), we will refund your lower tier sub and transfer your payment back to you.</strong></i></p>
  <p>To avoid any abuse of this rule. We will only refund the first time you upgrade. If you upgrade your subscription more than once within a short period of time, we will reserve the right not to refund you.</p>
