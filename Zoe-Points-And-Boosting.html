</div><blockquote class="is-info">
<p>Zoe points are used to boost a Discord server to gain access to the premium features. You can manage the servers you boost with the <code>/boost</code> command. <br><br>
Depending on your subscription, you will receive a certain number of Zoe points. Here is the list:</p>

<p>Once a server is boosted, you can enable&nbsp;premium features on it. With a subscription, you get a certain number of Zoe points that you can use. So you can distribute your points as you wish, as long as you have enough Zoe points.</p>

<p>The server's premium features&nbsp;no longer work and you will get your Zoe points back. You can use them again directly.</p>

</div><blockquote>
<p>The premium features&nbsp;will then no longer work, but your settings will not be deleted. So if you do not change your configuration in the meantime, a re-boost of your server will reactivate the premium features&nbsp;.</p>

</div><blockquote>
<p>It depends on the number of points you have left. Two cases can occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Either you have enough Zoe points left and the server remains boosted.</li>
<li>Or you do not have enough Zoe points and become overloaded. In this case you will receive a message warning you. Now you have several options: Cancel your boost on some servers, delete some league accounts from a server (to lower its category) or take a higher subscription to receive more points.</li>
