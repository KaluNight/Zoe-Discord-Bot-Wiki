# TFT Features

> Due to the limitations of the API, it was not possible to implement TFT for all features that Zoe offers. It is still difficult for us to extend certain features for TFT, but we have it in mind, that much is said.

<br>



## List of features
- [x] **Infochannel** (partially)
- [x] **Rankchannel**
- [x] **Leaderboards**
- [ ] Clashchannel
- [x] **stats commands** (partially)
- [ ] Matchhistorychannel
- [x] **Rank roles**
<br>

#### Infochannel
The TFT rank is shown in the infopanel, when [the corresponding infochannel configuration](/de/Zoe-Configuration/Infochannel/Infochannel-Rankfilter) is set to `Show TFT rank only` or `Show latest rank change`. Gamecards are not generated for TFT matches.
<br>

#### Rankchannel
Your ranked TFT match results will be shown in the rankchannel, when [the corresponding rankchannel configuration](/de/Zoe-Configuration/Rankchannel/Rankchannel-Filter) is set to `Show all types` or `TFT only`.
<br>

#### Leaderboards
When creating a [leaderboard](/de/features/leaderboards) for a specific queue rank, you can select `TFT` to show the best ranked TFT players of your server.
<br>

#### stats commands
Your TFT rank is shown on your [stats profile](/de/commands/stats/profile) card, under `Ranked Stats`. The other commands are not supported for TFT.
<br>

#### Rank roles
For rank roles, your TFT rank is taken into account (if it's the highest rank of a player). 
If you have a [premium subscription](/de/support), you can set `TFT` as the used queue in the configuration of the [improved rank roles](/de/features/rankroles).
