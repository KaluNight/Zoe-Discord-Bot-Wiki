<h1>Support Zoe - Premium Subscription</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p>Zoe is currently funded partly by the developer (KaluNight) and partly by the great people who donated before the Kofi site existed and <a href="https://zoe-discord-bot.ch/donate.html">those who do so now</a>.</p>
<p>But now that KaluNight's apprenticeship is over, he has not received any more money. That money was partly used to fund Zoe's servers. Now he pays for Zoe's server costs with his savings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Main expenses (estimation):</h4>
