<h1>Support Zoe</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p>Zoe is currently almost fully funded by the developer (KaluNight) (A big thank you to the few people who donated money before this page was set up). But now that his apprenticeship is over, he hasn't received any more money.</p>
<p>That money was partly used to fund Zoe's servers. Now he pays for Zoe's servers with his savings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This subscription is a way for those who want to support the project by getting some benefits. This ranges from supporter icons to early access features. This is not a "premium Zoe subscription", but rather a "support subscription". &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is clear that Zoe will remain completely free, no matter what because that was KaluNight´s original wish: To make Zoe accessible to everyone.</p>
