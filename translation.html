<h1>Zoe Translation</h1>
<h3>Here you can learn about how Zoe is translated.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zoe (and this Wiki in the future) is available in several languages. These are: <strong>English, French and German</strong> (complete). Aswell as<strong> Russian, Turkish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish</strong> (partially).</p>
<p>All translations have been done by the community. If you notice a<strong> mistake</strong>, you can<strong> report it on the Discord</strong> server (in #language-feedback). You can find the link <a href="https://discord.gg/k3SamTndZZ">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to <strong>help finish a translation</strong> that is not yet complete or <strong>add a new language</strong> (that you can translate to) click on the link to the Discord server and message the team in #check-in-translator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the guidelines for translations: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vS8cTyU2Y-qiI6wwX3WZLuhUACZ6Mr4w-KnSes86yY0-irBtNhuJDgxG3DsNgdgZo4i-XaReANHrwDn/pub?start=true&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=10000">Guidelines</a></p>
