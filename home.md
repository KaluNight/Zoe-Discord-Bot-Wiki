_Zoe is a Discord bot_ that provides an  [**information panel**](/en/features/infoChannel/) in a text channel with **information about the players in a game**, so you can immediately see who is available for a game.  ([infoChannel](/en/features/infoChannel/))

It also provides information about current games such as **champions played, SoloQ rank or winrate with a champion played.** ([gameCard](/en/features/gamecards/))

It is also possible to **track the players' ranked progress** in a text channel ([rankChannel](/en/features/rankChannel/)) or the **whole matchhistory** ([matchhistoryChannel](https://wiki.zoe-discord-bot.ch/en/features/matchhistoryChannel)).

Another feature are [**leaderboards**](/en/features/leaderboards/) in which up to 100 players ([boosted](https://wiki.zoe-discord-bot.ch/en/Zoe-Points-And-Boosting) server, otherwise 10) can compare themselves in a selected category. ([leaderboards](/en/features/leaderboards/))

Zoe can also perform an **analysis of your own and opposing clash teams** to help with pick and ban decisions. ([teamAnalysis](/en/commands/stats/teamAnalysis/) and [clashChannel](/en/features/clashChannel/))
