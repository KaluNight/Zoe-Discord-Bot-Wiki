# /create team team-name
## Information
**When you create a team with the chosen `team-name` with this command, the [players](/en/terms/player) (that you still have to add with [`/add playertoteam`](/en/commands/team/addplayer) will be displayed in the  [infopanel](/en/features/infochannel) under this team-name separately from all other registered [players](/en/terms/player). You can also get a quick overview over a team with the command [`/show team`](/en/commands/team/show).**
