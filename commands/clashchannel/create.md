# /create clashchannel clashchannel-name
## Information
**If you want to create a [clashchannel](/en/features/clashChannel), use this command and select a name you like for `clashchannel-name`, you still have to specify a [player](/en/terms/player) for the [clashchannel](/en/features/clashChannel) and select the appropriate time zone. To do this, you have to navigate through the pages or send Zoe the fitting details. The [clashchannel](/en/features/clashChannel) is now created and the next clash dates are displayed. If a clash takes place, you can start a team analysis here, for more information see [/clash analysis](/en/commands/clash/analysis).**<br>

### Permissions needed:
>**Manage channels** - only users with this permission ("moderators"/"administrators") can use this command as it affects Zoe for the server more deeply {.is-warning}

<br>

## Usage
:one: Start by creating the clashchannel with:
<img src="/en_/en_create_clashchannel_riotid_1.png" width="60%"><br>
:two: After that you need to give Zoe an account by their [region](/en/terms/region), [gamename and tag](/en/terms/riotid):
<img src="/en_/en_create_clashchannel_riotid_2.png" width="40%"><br>
:three: Finally give Zoe a timezone by number from a list Zoe provides:
