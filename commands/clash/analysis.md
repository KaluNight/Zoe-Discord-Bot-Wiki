# /clash analysis region gamename tag

<br>

>### Information: 
>**This command only works if the specified user is in a full clash team. Only then Zoe sends an analysis of the team. If this command is sent within a [clashchannel](/en/features/clashChannel), the [region](/en/terms/region) is not mandatory.
Zoe gives you information about 3 possible picks, a flexpick and probable bans against your team.
If you want to analyse an opposing team, you need a [gamename and tag (Riot ID)](/en/terms/riotid) of a player of the opposing team.**
