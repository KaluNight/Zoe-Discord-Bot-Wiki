# /create infochannel infochannel-name

>### Information
>**This command creates a new [infochannel](/en/features/infoChannel) with the name you choose for the parameter `infochannel-name`. In this channel, Zoe sends the so-called [infopanel](/en/features/infoChannel) in which information about the registered [players](/en/terms/player), their accounts and (if enabled) their rank of a certain queue or the last game played is shown. Zoe also sends the [gamecards](/en/features/gamecards) to this channel (if enabled). You can also get [champion tips](/en/features/champion-analysis) for every champion played in a game.**
