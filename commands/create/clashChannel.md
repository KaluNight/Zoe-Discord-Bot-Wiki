>**If you want to create a clashChannel, use this command and select a name you like for `clashchannel-name`, you still have to specify a player for the clashChanel and select the appropriate time zone. To do this, you have to navigate through the pages or send Zoe the fitting details. The clash channel is now created and the next clash dates are displayed.
