# /create clashchannel clashchannel-name

>### Information
>**If you want to create a [clashchannel](/en/features/clashChannel), use this command and select a name you like for `clashchannel-name`, you still have to specify a [player](/en/terms/player) for the [clashchannel](/en/features/clashChannel) and select the appropriate time zone. To do this, you have to navigate through the pages or send Zoe the fitting details. The [clashchannel](/en/features/clashChannel) is now created and the next clash dates are displayed. If a clash takes place, you can start a team analysis here, for more information see [/clash analysis](/en/commands/clash/analysis).**
