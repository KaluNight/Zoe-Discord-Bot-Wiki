# /stats teamanalysis

>### Information
>**When you execute this command you have to specify 5 accounts with [`region`](/en/terms/region), [`gamename, tag (Riot ID)`](/en/terms/riotid) and optionally add a lane so that Zoe can start an analysis. Zoe evaluates who could play what on which position (if not already defined).** <br>
>**Works similar to [`/clash analysis`](https://wiki.zoe-discord-bot.ch/en/commands/clash/analysis) but without the clash team.**
