# Register command

>Here you can select whether the command [`/register`](/en/commands/player/register) should be enabled. If this is the case, every Discord user can [register an account](/en/commands/player/register) on the server.

>If this option is enabled, anyone can [register accounts](/en/commands/administrative/register/) that do not belong to them. If you want to prevent this, it is recommended that you disable the command or [ensure the account owner verification](/en/Zoe-Configuration/Usermanagment/Verification). Note that this will lengthen the registration process.
