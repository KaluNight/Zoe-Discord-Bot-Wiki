# Hide infochannel with a role
## Information
**With this setting you can hide the [infochannel](/en/features/infochannel) from not [registered/created players](/en/terms/player) with a role. Zoe will assign this role to every [registered/created player](/en/terms/player) and set the channels permissions accordingly. If you delete the role the option will be deactivated automatically.
Keep in mind that you change the role permissions, but Zoe needs to have the permission to assign it!**

## Procedure
:one: Click on the corresponding setting in the configuration menu.

:three: Now the role `Zoe-Player` will be created and the channels permissions set so only discord users with the role can see the [infochannel](/en/features/infochannel).
