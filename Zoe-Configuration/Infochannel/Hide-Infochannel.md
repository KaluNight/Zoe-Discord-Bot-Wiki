# Hide infochannel with a role

>With this setting you can hide the [infochannel](/en/features/infoChannel) from not [registered/created players](/en/terms/player) with a role. Zoe will assign this role to every [registered/created player](/en/terms/player) and set the channels permissions accordingly. If you delete the role the option will be deactivated automatically.

>Keep in mind that you change the role permissions, but Zoe needs to have the permission to assign it !
>{.is-warning}

> Click on the corresponding setting :one:in the configuration menu.

Now the role `Zoe-Player` will be created and the channels permissions set so only discord users with the role can see the [infochannel](/en/features/infoChannel).

After that the role is assigned to all [registered/created players](/en/terms/player).
