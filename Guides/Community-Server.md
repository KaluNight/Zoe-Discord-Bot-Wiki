>**You want to use Zoe on a community Discord server?** 
We are talking about a server that is not just a team or a group of friends. Here you can find a "template" on how to set up Zoe for this use.
The (current) _starting state_ should be that you have **invited Zoe** and have done the first two steps: **set the language and the default region** (see [Zoe Setup](/en/setup)).
