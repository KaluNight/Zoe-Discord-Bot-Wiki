By default, Zoe displays the rank of the last game queue per player. This means that if their last game was a ranked flex, this change will be displayed.

You can change this behaviour in Zoe's configuration as follows:

Use /config to get into Zoe's confuguration- select the option for infochannel and in the menu select 6️⃣.
