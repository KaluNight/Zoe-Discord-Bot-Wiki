<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Zoe is a Discord bot</u> that provides an&nbsp;<strong> </strong><a href="/en/features/infoChannel/"><strong>information panel</strong></a> in a text channel with <strong>information about the players in a game</strong>, so you can immediately see who is available for a game. &nbsp;(<a href="/en/features/infoChannel/">infoChannel</a>)</p>
<p>It also provides information about current games such as <strong>champions played, SoloQ rank or winrate with a champion played.&nbsp;</strong> (<a href="/en/features/gamecards/">gameCard</a>)</p>
<p>It is also possible to<strong> track the players' ranked progress </strong>in a text channel (<a href="/en/features/rankChannel/">rankChannel</a>) or the <strong>whole matchhistory</strong> (<a href="https://wiki.zoe-discord-bot.ch/en/features/matchhistoryChannel">matchhistoryChannel</a>).</p>
<p>Another feature are <a href="/en/features/leaderboards/"><strong>leaderboards</strong></a> in which up to 100 players (boosted server, otherwise 10) can compare themselves in a selected category. (<a href="/en/features/leaderboards/">leaderboards</a>)</p>
<p>Zoe can also perform an <strong>analysis of your own and opposing clash teams</strong> to help with pick and ban decisions. (<a href="/en/features/stats-teamanalysis/">teamAnalysis</a> and <a href="/en/features/clashChannel/">clashChannel</a>)</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How can I deactivate smart mode / change the mode?</h2>
<p>As a user, you cannot deactivate smart mode or change the mode itself. Zoe automatically decides which mode to run in based on the current load. If you want to learn more about refreshing click <a href="/en/terms/refresh-mode/">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>In which languages is Zoe available ?</h2>
<p>Zoe is currently fully translated into English and German and partially translated into French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, Russian and Arabic as well as Turkish. These translations are done by the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can I define several channels (Info &amp; RankChannel) in one text channel?</h2>
<p>Yes, this works in itself, but not really, because all messages in Zoe's info channel that do not belong there are deleted, including those from the RankChannel. Please try to not mix these channels.</p>
<p>If you have the problem that the messages are deleted, you can undefine one of the two channels and define it again in another text channel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Which games are / why is flex&nbsp;displayed in infopanel?</h2>
<p>The InfoPanel always shows the last update of the rank. If your last game was a flex game, this change is shown.</p>
